# HOMEWORK_ASSIGNMENT_AD


Assuming that you have Windows as your main OS, you have to accomplish some basic things before : 

Install C on your computer(assuming that you want to run your code from Command Prompt) :

Tutorial : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw

OR :

Install CodeBlocks Editor on your computer (if you want to run it into an integrated environment) : Code Blocks download latest version (fosshub.com) : 

https://www.fosshub.com/Code-Blocks.html?dwl=codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe

To run in Command Prompt : First, be sure that you are into the root directory of the application :

Use “cd” command to enter the root directory (for me it’s HOMEWORK_ASSIGNMENT_AD, assuming that you know already where is the root folder, you have to link also the general destination first… For example: if you have the root directory into Downloads, you will use cd to enter into Downloads folder):

     cd TEMA_DE_CASA_AD
     
Then run :

     gcc main.c -o main.exe

Into CodeBlocks you will open the “.cbp” file from the root folder which is associated with your codeBlocks project.

The code is working well, is printing the generated random data into “code_editor_in.txt” and the computed results into “code_editor_out.txt”
